Personal Major project plan, where to put? -> txt file in the repo

* sort out proper git version controlling

* revise DL w/ tensorflow writing everything yourself not purely relying on AI so you understand every line and be able to elaborate on every decision

* go back to the current system, implement DLA and play around w/ parameters + include things like trainign graphs etc so you justify your params decisions. & those that aren't clear you just look up online on how ppl are choosing them i.e. is it manual is it automatic ... etc+ organise the notebook so sections are clear + make sure you've actually implemented exactly what the paper proposed.

* futher reading stage - read more DL papers (either DPD or else) for potential inspiration to come up w/ your own novel idea. could be RNNs, inspirations from LSTMs/LLMs, ….. etc, need to read a ton of papers for inspiration - basically you can then present yourself as someone who have great skillset in DL - DL researcher basically. 

* with the above u actually would be able to write an innovative piece of work/report w/ proper references. 

* also you would have actually learnt sthg new out of this major project not just that its for a "mark" - if you keep reading a ton of DL research you may have surpassed a CS-grad project which actually what puts u on the lead --- so those who u're currently comparing with NOT EEs --- you need to be confident in AI discussions later on as well w/ ML/DL SW researchers. 

* so this major proj aint just for its sake but rather useful work.


but what's the timeline for all the above?

TF revision + GHUB => 1 day (rest BSNS)

Parameter tweaking + DLA implementation + matching against reference paper (2 days)

further DL research reading (NOTE ALL NOTES W/ REFERENCES MUST BE LOGGED ON NOTION SO WHEN IT'S TIME FOR REPORT WRITING YOU KNOW YOUR THING !!! W/ A BACKUP PLACE SAY IN CASE GMAIL GONE)
