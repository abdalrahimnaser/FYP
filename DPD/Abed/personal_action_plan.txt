Personal Action Plan

Motivation: Introduce a DL innovaiton worthy of publishing -> challenging my status quo & moivation to do the same in other fields like embedded (i did that before)

* revise DL fundamentals w/ TF (andrew NG -> TF notebooks -> TF cheatsheet -> fill missing w/ gemeni (like design choices etc)) && Take Notes

* Implement DLA && optimize setup

* Further DL paper reading (RNNs, inspirations from other fields, etc.)
- you must be taking notes down w/ references so you can justify your decisions later on in the report.

* Integration & Further reading

==================

Timeline:
week 3 => first two points
weeks 4 & 5 => reading
week 6 => Integration
weeks 7 & 8 & 9 => further reading + plan for HG
weeks 10 & 11 -> report
